# kevchat

Here's a simple app you can use to chat with me.
I'll try to check it now and then.
A bit more fun than an email, I think.

## Setup

`npm install` && `npm start`

## Notes

There is no auth here, because these messages aren't super sensitive.
This means someone can pretend to be you.
That's ok.
A hacker might even delete all my messages.
That is also ok.
